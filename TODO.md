# TestSet

* test conservation of total energy $m \dot{r}^2 /2 + V(r)$
* Verlet table: impose distance cutoffs, approximate potential by zero if 
* use Verlet time discretization scheme 1.2
* if total energy is negative, bounded motion; else, conllisional dynamics
* linear momentum, angular momentum conserved IN ABSENCE OF BOUNDARY CONDITIONS
* periodic boundary conditions: minimum image convention
